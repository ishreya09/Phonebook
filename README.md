# Phonebook

A phone book is a collection of the data required to contact certain individuals such as their name, 
phone numbers, address, email, etc. We have created a virtual phone book using Python. The user has 
to input the data in the various fields present and the project converts them into a list. Graphical User 
Interface has been added using Tkinter and various concepts such as importing functions from another 
file, timestamp, etc., have been used. The project was made using Visual Studio Code.
